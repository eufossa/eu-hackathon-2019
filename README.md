The [EU-FOSSA](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eu-fossa-2/about) project developed by [European institutions](https://europa.eu/) is aiming at improving the security of Open Source Software.

As part of EU-FOSSA 2, the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/) is organising several [hackathons](https://eufossahackathon.bemyapp.com/) where developers from both the projects and the European Institutions that rely on their software, can come together.
