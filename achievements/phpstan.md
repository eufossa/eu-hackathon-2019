# PHPStan

## About

[PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) is a PHP Static Analysis Tool.

It focuses on finding errors in your code without actually running it.

## Goals and achievements

See the [full article about the PHPStan 0.12 release and EU-FOSSA hackathon](https://medium.com/@ondrejmirtes/phpstan-0-12-released-f1a88036535d).

> We were honored to be invited to the event. It was a great opportunity to achieve two full days-worth of open-source work what would otherwise take weeks of constant interruptions and back-and-forths. It definitely sped up the development of PHPStan 0.12 and helped bringing it to the final release this year.
