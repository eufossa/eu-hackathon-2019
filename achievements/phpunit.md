# PHPUnit

## About

[PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) is the de-facto standard for implementing automated tests for software that is implemented using the [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) programming language. While its focus is, as the name suggests, on [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), PHPUnit can also be used to implement characterization tests, regression tests, integration tests, edge-to-edge tests, and end-to-end tests, for instance.

## Achievements

The PHPUnit Project was represented by Sebastian Bergmann, Ewout Pieter den Ouden, Andreas Möller, Arne Blankerts, and Stefan Priebsch at the EU-FOSSA 2 Hackathon. Such an event provides the rare opportunity for an Open Source project's contributors to engage in face-to-face discussions, especially for planning large-scale changes to the software.

One such large-scale change was discussed in depth at the hackathon: a new system for extending PHPUnit based on events. A technical documentation of this discussion is available [here](https://gist.github.com/localheinz/7b3a84f2c9b2dc446aef5e48f97ac1c8) and a working draft implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/theseer/phpunit/pull/1).

Furthermore, Stefan Priebsch moderated a [discussion](https://github.com/eufossa/eu-hackathon-2019/issues/17) of topics raised during Sebastian Bergmann's [keynote](https://twitter.com/s_bergmann/status/1180801252957011968).
