# Mercure

## About

[Mercure](https://mercure.rocks/) is a protocol allowing to push data updates to web browsers and other HTTP clients in a convenient, fast, reliable and battery-efficient way. It is especially useful to publish async and real-time updates of resources served through web APIs, to reactive web and mobile apps.

## Goals and achievements

* Fix issues on Windows
* Improve debugging
* Improve documentation
* Add Mercure to the OpenAPI spec

> All our goals have been reached, and we also published a new release containing all the improvements! Thanks for organizing this hackathon, it was great!
